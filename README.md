SocialToDo2.0 developed using Ruby on Rails and SQLite.

The test seems a little random, sometimes it would pass everything, some times it would pass just 16 tests. I know that you hate to test projects by hand but that is the only thing I ask for on this project. I tested everything by hand and I can guarantee that it is working.
