#SocialToDo2.0

Heroku link: https://socialtodo2.herokuapp.com

SocialToDo2.0 developed using Ruby on Rails and SQLite.
Deployed with heroku (Ruby on Rails and Postgres).

The test seems a little random, sometimes it would pass everything, some times it would pass just 35 tests. I really don't know why. So test more than once to be sure of the results (In doubt test manually).

Any problem email: willian.kawakami@yale.edu

Thanks.
Have fun.
